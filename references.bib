abstract = {This paper presents a review on the performance of Savonius wind turbines. This type of turbine is unusual and its application for obtaining useful energy from air stream is an alternative to the use of conventional wind turbines. Simple construction, high start up and full operation moment, wind acceptance from any direction, low noise and angular velocity in operation, reducing wear on moving parts, are some advantages of using this type of machine. Over the years, numerous adaptations for this device were proposed. The variety of possible configurations of the rotor is another advantage in using such machine. Each different arrangement of Savonius rotor affects its performance. Savonius rotor performance is affected by operational conditions, geometric and air flow parameters. The range of reported values for maximum averaged power coefficient includes values around 0.05–0.30 for most settings. Performance gains of up to 50% for tip speed ratio of maximum averaged power coefficient are also reported with the use of stators. Present article aims to gather relevant information about Savonius turbines, bringing a discussion about their performance. It is intended to provide useful knowledge for future studies.}

abstract = {The world adopts a policy of energy transition, which refers to the substitution of fossil fuels by renewable energies to reduce CO2 emission, however the major issue is to develop a wind turbine which has a simple design, a relatively low operating speed and independent wind directions, the savonius rotor appears to be promising for such conditions, but suffers from major drawbacks: low efficiency and high negative torque.so far several scientific researchers aims to improve the performances of savonius turbine, by optimizing the effects of different geometric parameters and by developing new design. The range of the power coefficient values for the conventional Savonius rotors is between 0.1 and 0.25. The installation of several extra set leads to new designs which achieve an improvement in the coefficient of performance of 27.3% compared to the conventional rotor.}

Using computational tools such as Solidworks, Inventor, Simulation Mechanical, the design stage was validated through simulation to study the dynamic fluid behavior and the components were modeled to evaluate their response to wind loads, verifying their resistance. Subsequently, according to the modeling, the detailed drawings of the components of the turbine were obtained, with which they were assembled. Finally, having the physical model of the Savonius wind turbine, experimental tests were carried out in the laboratory of Fluids and Hydraulic Machines of the Technological University of Pereira.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

Vertical axis wind turbines offer promising solution for areas away from the integrated grid systems. However, they have certain drawbacks associated with different configurations. This paper reviews various configurations of VAWT along with their merits and demerits. Moreover, design techniques employed for VAWT design have also been reviewed along with their results. It was learned that coefficient of power (CP) for various configurations is different and can be optimized with reference to Tip Speed Ratio. Latest emerging design techniques can be helpful in this optimization. Furthermore, flow field around the blade can also be investigated with the help of these design techniques for safe operation.}

abstract = {In this paper, numerical and experimental studies are presented to determine the operating performance and power output from a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). A k-ɛ turbulence model is used to perform the transient simulations. The 3-D numerical predictions are based on the time averaged Spalart-Allmaras equations. A case study is performed for varying VAWT stator vane (tab) geometries of a Zephyr vertical axis wind turbine. The mean velocity is used to predict the time averaged variations of the power coefficient and power output. Power coefficients predicted by the numerical models are compared for different turbine geometries. The predictive capabilities of the numerical model are verified by past experimental data, as well as wind tunnel experiments in the current paper, to compare two particular geometric designs. The numerical results examine the turbine's performance at constant and variable rotor velocities. The effects of stator vanes on the turbine's power output are presented and discussed.}

    abstract = "{The design and development of wind turbines is increasing throughout the world to offer electricity without paying much to the global warming. The Savonius wind turbine rotor, or simply the Savonius rotor, is a drag-based device that has a relatively low efficiency. A high negative torque produced by the returning blade is a major drawback of this rotor. Despite having a low efficiency, its design simplicity, low cost, easy installation, good starting ability, relatively low operating speed, and independency to wind direction are its main rewards. With the goal of improving its power coefficient (CP), a considerable amount of investigation has been reported in the past few decades, where various design modifications are made by altering the influencing parameters. Concurrently, various augmentation techniques have also been used to improve the rotor performance. Such augmenters reduce the negative torque and improve the self-starting capability while maintaining a high rotational speed of the rotor. The CP of the conventional Savonius rotors lie in the range of 0.12–0.18, however, with the use of augmenters, it can reach up to 0.52 with added design complexity. This paper attempts to give an overview of the various augmentation techniques used in Savonius rotor over the last four decades. Some of the key findings with the use of these techniques have been addressed and makes an attempt to highlight the future direction of research.}",

Multi-bladed rotor, multistage rotor, shape of the blade, use of deflecting plate, guide vanes and nozzle augmentation are several ways to enhance the performance characteristics.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The derivation of the efficiency of an ideal wind turbine has been attributed to the three famous scientists of the three aerodynamic research schools in Europe during the first decades of the previous century: Lanchester, Betz and Joukowsky. However, detailed reading of their classical papers has shown that Lanchester did not accept Froude's result that the velocity through the disc is the average of the velocities far upstream and far downstream, by which his solution is not determined. Betz and Joukowsky used vortex theory to support Froude's result and derived the ideal efficiency of a wind turbine at the same time. This efficiency has been known as the Joukowsky limit in Russia and as the Betz limit everywhere else. Because of the contribution of both scientists, this result should be called the Betz–Joukowsky limit everywhere. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These coefficients are used to realize the analysis of a wind turbine, depending on the type of turbine, which is used. The coefficients of power and torque establish the relationship between wind power and power obtained in the turbine. In the review were found various models, the goal of this paper is to classify to find a general model, however, due to the characteristics of the models found, the models were classified into three general groups. Each group was classified according to their mathematical expression, which was exponential, sinusoidal and polynomial. The exponential and sinusoidal models include variations in relation to the specific speed and the pitch angle; and the polynomial models only depend on the specific speed. The models consider the real characteristics of wind turbines. The purpose of this review is to establish mathematical models of power coefficient and torque coefficient, in order to evaluate different models of wind turbines on the emulator.},

ABSTRACT = {Small-scale vertical-axis wind power generation technologies such as Savonius wind turbines are gaining popularity in suburban and urban settings. Although vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) may not be as efficient as their horizontal-axis counterparts, they often present better opportunities for integration within building structures. The main issue stems from the suboptimal aerodynamic design of Savonius turbine blades, resulting in lower efficiency and power output. To address this, modern turbine designs focus on optimizing various geometric aspects of the turbine to improve aerodynamic performance, efficiency, and overall effectiveness. This study developed a unique optimization method, incorporating a new blade geometry with guide gap flow for Savonius wind turbine blade design. The aerodynamic characteristics of the Savonius wind turbine blade were extensively analyzed using 3D ANSYS CFX software. The optimization process emphasized the power coefficient as the objective function while considering blade profiles, overlap ratio, and blade number as crucial design parameters. This objective was accomplished using the design of experiments (DOE) method with the Minitab statistical software. The research findings revealed that the novel turbine design “OR0.109BS2BN2” outperformed the reference turbine with a 22.8% higher power coefficient. Furthermore, the results indicated a trade-off between the flow (swirling flow) through the gap guide flow and the impact blockage ratio, which resulted from the reduced channel width caused by the extended blade tip length.},
